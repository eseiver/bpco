1.  Think of someone you know...who has no resources or family to help him or her.
    Who are you thinking about?

2.  What would be most helpful to him or her?
    Sometimes history can help us to design a strategy for today.
    It may help to look at what you judge to have been effective in the past
    (either in personal experience or historical experience).
    Or you can answer with all new ideas.
