title: Fostering a Group That Meets Its Members' Needs
---

Gather your members (or leadership committee, or subset of members) in group.

**First have each person answer this question individually:**

What needs is your organization not meeting that would make you a more productive or committed member?
[____________________]

**Then, turn to the group:**

Using large post-it notes,
ask every member of the group to write down what his or her answer was to the above question.
Collect the post-its and put them on the wall or on a large flip chart.
Allow the group time to look at them so they can see what others want.

Now discuss what you have seen.
Ask any clarifying questions.
See if some people will make commitments to do what others want.
See if the organization can make any changes to do what people want.
