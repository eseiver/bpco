One way to start to "screw your head on backwards",
to internalize the Iron Rule of Organizing,
is to examine your own thoughts and feelings.
If you have read this far you are probably a person who has a habit
of taking responsibility for making sure that things go right.
You have probably figured out somewhere along the way that not everyone is like you.
Not doing for people what they can do for themselves can be a constant battle.
This exercise might help.
You may want to do it many times, for different projects and tasks.
If so, just write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.

1.  Think of a specific project or job that needs to get done in your organization:
    [____________________]

2.  What stops you from letting go of a job or responsibility you can do,
    and letting someone else do it?
    [____________________]

3.  What might happen if it does not get done right?
    [____________________]

4.  Or if it does not get done the way you would do it?
    [____________________]

5.  What is the result of your doing everything?
    [____________________]

6.  Even if you can do it right, where does this lead you?
    [____________________]

7.  Other thoughts and reflections:
    [____________________]
