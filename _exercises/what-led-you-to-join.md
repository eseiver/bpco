---

1.  Think of a time in your life.
    (It could be any time–far back in your childhood or just last week.)
    What group or groups did you join?
    *   Group 1: [____________________]
    *   Group 2: [____________________]

2.  What led you to join these groups?
    [____________________]

3.  What was the immediately preceding event?
    [____________________]

4.  Think about the specific event–not your frame of mind,
    not what you thought about the organization–but what was the *specific action* that led you to join?

5.  How did you hear about the group?
    From whom and in what way?
    [____________________]

6.  If a person asked you to join, how did he or she ask you?
    Was it in person?  Over the phone?  By letter?  By email?
    [____________________]

7.  What did the person actually say?
    What were the specific words used?
    [____________________]

8.  What else do you remember about what happened just before you joined?
