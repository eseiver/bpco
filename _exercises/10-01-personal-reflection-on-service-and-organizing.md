title: "Personal Reflection on Service and Organizing"
---

This exercise is designed to help you think about your own motivations,
the focus of your organization,
the operating values and assumptions implicit in your group's structure and culture,
and the impact of your work.
Compare your answers to the choices listed below each question,
which describe how pure service and pure organizing strategies might address the same question.
For each question,
take a minute to think about the similarities and differences.

Most people and most groups are more complex than the oversimplified opposites printed here.
Most likely, you're no exception.
The purpose of this exercise is to push you to think about your work in terms of service vs. organizing,
so the distinction between the two is highlighted.
The intention is not to describe your reality in all its real-life complexity,
but to increase your understanding of the strategy or strategies your organization uses.
